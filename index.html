<h3> About Me</h3>

  <p>	-	Coding never crossed my mind however I was always curious about 
    technology and how things work. I remember when my dad bought our 
    first PC in 1998. It just had the MS-DOS operation system on it. 
    I taught myself how to send and receive emails as I wanted to chat with my 
    friends. Once I set my mind to solving a particular problem I am very motivated,
     persistent, resourceful and creative in finding solutions. </p>
  <hr class="dots">
<p>
  I have NCFE CACHE Level2 Certificate in Understanding working in the Health 
  Sector, a Bachelor Degree in “Business administration and management” and few 
  other certificates in coaching, time planning and leadership.  </p>
    
  <hr class="dots">
    <p>  
      I have been self-employed for the 
      last 10 years working in cosmetic sales. I prepared and delivered presentations,
       created motivational programs for my team, and ran structured training sessions.</p>
   
       <hr class="dots">
    <p>
      My husband has worked closely with software developers in 
      the past and always believed that I would be great at coding. He saw that I
       like to solve problems, am very patient and methodical in searching for solutions but
        I always resisted the idea as I thought that you need to be exceptional at maths 
        and computer science for coding.  </p>
    
        <hr class="dots">
     <p>  
      I found out about “Founders and Coders” from a 
      housemate who’s the head of HR in a Health-Tech NGO. She mainly recruits 
      software developers and has hired a few graduates from “founders and coders”. 
      She told me about your bootcamps and your different approach to teaching. When I 
      researched FAC I found an incredible community of inspirational people, hungry for 
      knowledge to change their lives and potentially change the world!</p>
   
      <hr class="dots">
    <p>
    My journey in coding started in March 2020 after I decided to apply for a summer 
    cohort. I started to solve the prerequisite tasks on the “freeCodeCamp” site. I 
    was so engrossed in the exercises that I spent days and days just implementing 
    small missions. It really hooked me in. It was such a great feeling to create 
    something, to learn how everything works and to solve problems.  </p>
    
    <hr class="dots">
      <p> 
      I’ve run through many of the tasks on the FCC page multiple times now.  
        The first time everything was very new, exciting and unfamiliar to me. After 
        I put all my knowledge into practise by creating a web page and solving Kata’s, 
        I ran through the tasks a second time, everything made even more sense and really 
        crystallised in my mind. It was like a small revelation!</p>
 
  
        <hr class="dots">
     <p>
    I’m very passionate about travel, baking, reading, phycology, self-learning, 
    and gardening </p>
  
    <hr class="dots">
    <p>
  For me coding is like baking a cake. You need to follow very specific instructions; 
      however there’s a level of flexibility and creativity to express yourself in very 
      unique ways. </p>

  <h3> My Why</h3>
<p>

  -	I am always interested in learning new skills and am energised by the prospect of 
  diving into an exciting new long term career. I think “Founders and Coders” is a 
  fantastic way to do this. I like the idea of FAC as a community of like-minded people 
  and I would love to be a part of it. I know that I can learn a lot from others and believe
   that I have a lot to give back.
