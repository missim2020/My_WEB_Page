    <p class="text">Coding never crossed my mind however, 
      I was always curious about technology and how things work.
       In 1998, my dad bought our first PC. On it, there only 
       existed the MS-DOS operation system. Using our PC, I taught
        myself how to send and receive emails as I wanted to chat 
        with my friends. Once I set my mind to solving a particular 
        problem, I am very motivated, persistent, resourceful and 
        creative in finding solutions. </p>
    <hr class="dots">
  <p class="text">
    I have NCFE CACHE Level2 Certificate in Understanding 
    Working in the Health Sector, a Bachelor Degree in Business 
    Administration and Management and few other certificates 
    in coaching, time planning and leadership.   </p>
      
    <hr class="dots">
      <p class="text">  
        I have been self-employed for the last 10 years working 
        in cosmetic sales. During this time, I prepared and delivered
         presentations, created motivational programs for my team, 
         and ran structured training sessions.</p>
     
         <hr class="dots">
      <p class="text">
        My partner has worked closely with software developers 
        in the past and always believed that I would be great at 
        coding. He recognised my ability to solve problems with 
        patience and search for solutions methodically. However, 
        I always resisted the idea as I presumed that coding 
        required exceptional skills in maths and computer science.  </p>
      
          <hr class="dots">
       <p class="text">  
        I found out about “Founders and Coders” from a housemate 
        who’s the Head of HR in a Health-Tech NGO. She mainly 
        recruits software developers and has hired a few graduates 
        from “founders and coders”. She made me aware of your 
        bootcamps and your different approach to teaching. When 
        I researched FAC I found an incredible community of 
        inspirational people, hungry for knowledge. I could see 
        their motivation to change their lives and potentially 
        change the world!</p>
     
        <hr class="dots">
      <p class="text">
        My journey in coding started in March 2020 after I 
        decided to apply for a summer cohort. I started to solve 
        the prerequisite tasks on the “freeCodeCamp” site. 
        I was so engrossed in the exercises that I spent days 
        and days just implementing small missions. It really 
        grasped my attention. It was such a great feeling to 
        create something, to learn how everything works and to 
        solve problems.</p>
      
      <hr class="dots">
        <p class="text"> 
          I’ve run through many of the tasks on the FCC page, 
          multiple times.  The first time everything was very 
          new, exciting and unfamiliar to me. After I put all my
           knowledge into practise by creating a web page and 
           solving Kata’s, I ran through the tasks a second time.
            Everything became even more clear and really 
            crystallised in my mind. It was like a small revelation!</p>
       
          <hr class="dots">
       <p class="text">
        I’m very passionate about travel, baking, reading, 
        psychology, self-learning, and gardening.<br>  
        Speak: English, Lithuanian, Russian, German languages 
        and now I’m learning Arabic language. 
         </p>
    
      <hr class="dots">
      <p class="text">
      For me coding is like baking a cake. 
      You need to follow very specific instructions; however, 
      there’s a level of flexibility and creativity to express 
      yourself in very unique ways. </p>

<article class="article_My_Why">

<p class="textWhy">
    This is third time I have tried to get onto this course. 
    The first time was for the 2020 summer cohort. As soon as 
    I found out about the possibility of joining this community, 
    I started trying to fulfil all the necessary prerequisites. 
    After a while I realised that I didn’t have enough time to 
    finish everything, absorb all information and be ready to 
    apply, so I decided to give myself some extra time to digest 
    everything and wait until the winter cohort.  
  </p>
  
  <p class="textWhy">
    Before the winter application opening, 
    I had almost finished all my prerequisites. 
    I then learned, suddenly, that the winter cohort had been 
    cancelled. I would be lying if I was to say that I didn’t 
    feel sad. Of course, I did, but life didn’t stop, and I still
     had hope. I didn’t stop learning and now I'm applying for 
     this spring cohort. I really hope that the third time 
     I’ll be lucky, and I will be accepted onto this course. 
     Fingers crossed.
  </p>
  
  <p class="textWhy">
    I came to this country 2 years ago; not to find a better life,
     but to be with my partner. I left my family, close friends
      and a job that I loved, with the hope to start a new life 
      here. When I arrived, I felt like a small girl in the big, 
      big world: no friends, no education (my degree here had no 
      value and I didn't want to work in management) and virtually 
      no language. I had to start everything from scratch, and I 
      lacked confidence. 
    I understood that I had two choices: sit at home and cry or 
    do something about it. I decided to move forward. I learned 
    the language, finished a social care course with the hope to 
    start my first job in my new home, but COVID-19 changed all 
    my plans. So, I needed to find another way to realise myself,
     to create, and be useful to society.
  </p>
  <p class="textWhy"> 

    Deep inside I always wanted to be part of a community, to 
    do something important. It was by accident that I was 
    introduced to programing, but I truly believe that there 
    are no real accidents in life. Everything comes at the right 
    time.
  </p>
  <p class="textWhy"> So, now I'm writing to you through my own 
    built website (that I’m very proud of), with a big will to 
    go forward, to dive deeper in the ocean of knowledge. 
    I know that here in FAC I will find (and have already found) 
    an incredible community of amazing people and I know that 
    together we can create something mind-blowing what will 
    change the world.
