    <p>	Coding never crossed my mind however I was always curious about 
      technology and how things work. I remember when my dad bought our 
      first PC in 1998. It just had the MS-DOS operation system on it. 
      I taught myself how to send and receive emails as I wanted to chat with my 
      friends. Once I set my mind to solving a particular problem I am very motivated,
       persistent, resourceful and creative in finding solutions. </p>
    <hr class="dots">
  <p>
    I have NCFE CACHE Level2 Certificate in Understanding working in the Health 
    Sector, a Bachelor Degree in “Business administration and management” and few 
    other certificates in coaching, time planning and leadership.  </p>
      
    <hr class="dots">
      <p>  
        I have been self-employed for the 
        last 10 years working in cosmetic sales. I prepared and delivered presentations,
         created motivational programs for my team, and ran structured training sessions.</p>
     
         <hr class="dots">
      <p>
        My husband has worked closely with software developers in 
        the past and always believed that I would be great at coding. He saw that I
         like to solve problems, am very patient and methodical in searching for solutions but
          I always resisted the idea as I thought that you need to be exceptional at maths 
          and computer science for coding.  </p>
      
          <hr class="dots">
       <p>  
        I found out about “Founders and Coders” from a 
        housemate who’s the head of HR in a Health-Tech NGO. She mainly recruits 
        software developers and has hired a few graduates from “founders and coders”. 
        She told me about your bootcamps and your different approach to teaching. When I 
        researched FAC I found an incredible community of inspirational people, hungry for 
        knowledge to change their lives and potentially change the world!</p>
     
        <hr class="dots">
      <p>
      My journey in coding started in March 2020 after I decided to apply for a summer 
      cohort. I started to solve the prerequisite tasks on the “freeCodeCamp” site. I 
      was so engrossed in the exercises that I spent days and days just implementing 
      small missions. It really hooked me in. It was such a great feeling to create 
      something, to learn how everything works and to solve problems.  </p>
      
      <hr class="dots">
        <p> 
        I’ve run through many of the tasks on the FCC page multiple times now.  
          The first time everything was very new, exciting and unfamiliar to me. After 
          I put all my knowledge into practise by creating a web page and solving Kata’s, 
          I ran through the tasks a second time, everything made even more sense and really 
          crystallised in my mind. It was like a small revelation!</p>
       
          <hr class="dots">
       <p>
      I’m very passionate about travel, baking, reading, phycology, self-learning, 
      and gardening </p>
    
      <hr class="dots">
      <p>
    For me coding is like baking a cake. You need to follow very specific instructions; 
        however there’s a level of flexibility and creativity to express yourself in very 
        unique ways. </p>

<article class="My_Why">
  <h3> My Why</h3>
  <p>
I am always interested in learning new skills and am energised by the prospect 
of diving into a new and exciting career. I think “Founders and Coders” is a fantastic 
way to do this. I like the idea of FAC as a community of like-minded people and I would 
love to be a part of it. I know that I can learn a lot from others and believe that I have 
a lot to give back too. 
  </p>
  <hr class="dots">
  <p>
I have always been passionate about training people in my previous role. I found the 
meetup approach used at FAC inspirational and learned so much about myself from the 
experience:<br>
-By discussing a problem with others a solution already starts to form in my mind <br>

-Helping people to solve problems really increased my own motivation<br>

-By explaining things to others I memorise them better <br>

-After each meetup I felt very energised to not only complete all the 
prerequisite tasks, but to explore above and beyond the subject. I understood h
ow powerful this approach was and how much I can learn from this community by working 
collaboratively.<br>

  </p>
  <hr class="dots">
  <p>
I remember when I first created a very simple recipe page with the course at pirple.com 
and first solved a kata at codewars.com. I was so proud that I achieved something that I 
never thought I can do! This feeling of accomplishment propelled me onward to learn more; 
to create something mind blowing in the future.
