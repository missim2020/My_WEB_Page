        This is third time I have tried to get onto this course. 
        The first time was for the 2020 summer cohort. As soon as 
        I found out about the possibility of joining this community, 
        I started trying to fulfil all the necessary prerequisites. 
        After a while I realised that I didn’t have enough time to 
        finish everything, absorb all information and be ready to 
        apply, so I decided to give myself some extra time to digest 
        everything and wait until the winter cohort.  
      </p>
      
      <p class="text">
        Before the winter application opening, 
        I had almost finished all my prerequisites. 
        I then learned, suddenly, that the winter cohort had been 
        cancelled. I would be lying if I was to say that I didn’t 
        feel sad. Of course, I did, but life didn’t stop, and I still
         had hope. I didn’t stop learning and now I'm applying for 
         this spring cohort. I really hope that the third time 
         I’ll be lucky, and I will be accepted onto this course. 
         Fingers crossed.

        I came to this country 2 years ago; not to find a better life,
         but to be with my partner. I left my family, close friends
          and a job that I loved, with the hope to start a new life 
          here. When I arrived, I felt like a small girl in the big, 
          big world: no friends, no education (my degree here had no 
          value and I didn't want to work in management) and virtually 
          no language. I had to start everything from scratch, and I 
          lacked confidence. 
        I understood that I had two choices: sit at home and cry or 
        do something about it. I decided to move forward. I learned 
        the language, finished a social care course with the hope to 
        start my first job in my new home, but COVID-19 changed all 
        my plans. So, I needed to find another way to realise myself,
         to create, and be useful to society.

        Deep inside I always wanted to be part of a community, to 
        do something important. It was by accident that I was 
        introduced to programing, but I truly believe that there 
        are no real accidents in life. Everything comes at the right 
        time.
      </p>
      <p class="text"> So, now I'm writing to you through my own 
        built website (that I’m very proud of), with a big will to 
        go forward, to dive deeper in the ocean of knowledge. 
        I know that here in FAC I will find (and have already found) 
        an incredible community of amazing people and I know that 
        together we can create something mind-blowing what will 
        change the world.
