I am always interested in learning new skills and am energised by the prospect 
of diving into a new and exciting career. I think “Founders and Coders” is a fantastic 
way to do this. I like the idea of FAC as a community of like-minded people and I would 
love to be a part of it. I know that I can learn a lot from others and believe that I have 
a lot to give back too.

I have always been passionate about training people in my previous role. I found the 
meetup approach used at FAC inspirational and learned so much about myself from the 
experience:<br>
-By discussing a problem with others a solution already starts to form in my mind <br>
        
-Helping people to solve problems really increased my own motivation<br>
        
-By explaining things to others I memorise them better <br>
        
-After each meetup I felt very energised to not only complete all the 
prerequisite tasks, but to explore above and beyond the subject. I understood how powerful this approach was and how much I can learn from this community by working 
collaboratively.<br>

I remember when I first created a very simple recipe page with the course at pirple.com 
and first solved a kata at codewars.com. I was so proud that I achieved something that I 
never thought I can do! This feeling of accomplishment propelled me onward to learn more; 
to create something mind blowing in the future.
