            <p class="text">	Coding never crossed my mind however I was always curious about 
              technology and how things work. I remember when my dad bought our 
              first PC in 1998. It just had the MS-DOS operation system on it. 
              I taught myself how to send and receive emails as I wanted to chat with my 
              friends. Once I set my mind to solving a particular problem I am very motivated,
               persistent, resourceful and creative in finding solutions. </p>

            I have NCFE CACHE Level2 Certificate in Understanding working in the Health 
            Sector, a Bachelor Degree in “Business administration and management” and few 
            other certificates in coaching, time planning and leadership.  </p>

                I have been self-employed for the 
                last 10 years working in cosmetic sales. I prepared and delivered presentations,
                 created motivational programs for my team, and ran structured training sessions.</p>

                My husband has worked closely with software developers in 
                the past and always believed that I would be great at coding. He saw that I
                 like to solve problems, am very patient and methodical in searching for solutions but
                  I always resisted the idea as I thought that you need to be exceptional at maths 
                  and computer science for coding.  </p>

                I found out about “Founders and Coders” from a 
                housemate who’s the head of HR in a Health-Tech NGO. She mainly recruits 
                software developers and has hired a few graduates from “founders and coders”. 
                She told me about your bootcamps and your different approach to teaching. When I 
                researched FAC I found an incredible community of inspirational people, hungry for 
                knowledge to change their lives and potentially change the world!</p>

              My journey in coding started in March 2020 after I decided to apply for a summer 
              cohort. I started to solve the prerequisite tasks on the “freeCodeCamp” site. I 
              was so engrossed in the exercises that I spent days and days just implementing 
              small missions. It really hooked me in. It was such a great feeling to create 
              something, to learn how everything works and to solve problems.  </p>

                I’ve run through many of the tasks on the FCC page multiple times now.  
                  The first time everything was very new, exciting and unfamiliar to me. After 
                  I put all my knowledge into practise by creating a web page and solving Kata’s, 
                  I ran through the tasks a second time, everything made even more sense and really 
                  crystallised in my mind. It was like a small revelation!</p>

            For me coding is like baking a cake. You need to follow very specific instructions; 
                however there’s a level of flexibility and creativity to express yourself in very 
                unique ways. </p>
