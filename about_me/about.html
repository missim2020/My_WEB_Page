<p class="text">	Coding never crossed my mind however I was always curious about 
technology and how things work. I remember when my dad bought our 
first PC in 1998. It just had the MS-DOS operation system on it. 
I taught myself how to send and receive emails as I wanted to chat with my 
friends. Once I set my mind to solving a particular problem I am very motivated,
persistent, resourceful and creative in finding solutions. </p>

I have NCFE CACHE Level2 Certificate in Understanding working in the Health 
Sector, a Bachelor Degree in “Business administration and management” and few 
other certificates in coaching, time planning and leadership.  </p>

I have been self-employed for the 
last 10 years working in cosmetic sales. I prepared and delivered presentations,
created motivational programs for my team, and ran structured training sessions.</p>

My husband has worked closely with software developers in 
the past and always believed that I would be great at coding. He saw that I
like to solve problems, am very patient and methodical in searching for solutions but
I always resisted the idea as I thought that you need to be exceptional at maths 
and computer science for coding.  </p>

I found out about “Founders and Coders” from a 
housemate who’s the head of HR in a Health-Tech NGO. She mainly recruits 
software developers and has hired a few graduates from “founders and coders”. 
She told me about your bootcamps and your different approach to teaching. When I 
researched FAC I found an incredible community of inspirational people, hungry for 
knowledge to change their lives and potentially change the world!</p>

My journey in coding started in March 2020 after I decided to apply for a summer 
cohort. I started to solve the prerequisite tasks on the “freeCodeCamp” site. I 
was so engrossed in the exercises that I spent days and days just implementing 
small missions. It really hooked me in. It was such a great feeling to create 
something, to learn how everything works and to solve problems.  </p>
              
<hr class="dots">
<p class="text"> 
I’ve run through many of the tasks on the FCC page multiple times now.  
The first time everything was very new, exciting and unfamiliar to me. After 
I put all my knowledge into practise by creating a web page and solving Kata’s, 
I ran through the tasks a second time, everything made even more sense and really 
crystallised in my mind. It was like a small revelation!</p>
               
<hr class="dots">
<p class="text">
I’m very passionate about travel, baking, reading, phycology, self-learning, 
and gardening </p>
            
<hr class="dots">
<p class="text">
For me coding is like baking a cake. You need to follow very specific instructions; 
however there’s a level of flexibility and creativity to express yourself in very 
unique ways. </p>
